# Generative Methods

Welcome to my portfolio from CS 327: Generative Methods, a course focused on various techniques for creating generative art. Throughout the course, we covered a range of topics from basic particle systems to Tracery grammars to computer vision. 

## Projects

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific project completed during the course. Here's a brief overview:

- `A2/`: GIFs
- `A3/`: Brushes
- `A4/`: Particle Systems
- `A5/`: Parametric Spaces
- `A6/`: Chatbots
- `A7/`: Data Essay
- `A8/`: Face Tracking

## Technologies Used

Throughout this course, various tools and languages were used to create generative art:

- p5.js: A JavaScript library that simplifies the coding process for creating interactive visual arts. It's user-friendly and favored by artists and educators.
- d3.js: A JavaScript library ideal for creating complex and data-driven visualizations. It allows for the dynamic manipulation of document elements based on data input.
- Vue Components: Components of the Vue.js framework, enabling the development of interactive user interfaces. Useful in generative art for managing dynamic elements and user interactions efficiently.
